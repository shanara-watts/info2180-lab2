					My name is Shanara Watts. I am 20 years old. I was born on 
				December 3, 2000. I now attend the University of the West Indies,
				Mona, persuing a major in Information Technology. I always liked 
				using the computers and mobile devices, and learning its features. 
				However, studying it in school was never my initial study plan, 
				it was medicine was, because I wanted to become a forensic pathologist.
